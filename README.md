# dom-portfolio-v3
Version 3 of my portfolio, built with React, Typescript, and Chakra UI

# No more NextJS!
> I completely rewrote the site in regular React with Typescript. NextJS just wasn't the right choice for this website.
### Regular 'ol React
This website is made with React and ChakraUI. NextJS, while cool, was simple too big, clunky, opinionated, and difficult to work around.
I built V2 using the experimental App directory before NextJS13 was released, and due to the lack of documentation at the time it was difficult to fit ChakraUI into the picture.
