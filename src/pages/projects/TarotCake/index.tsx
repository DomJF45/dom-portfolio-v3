          Users can flip a card one by one to reveal the card in the time slot.
          Because it is based on a three card tarot draw, the cards represent in
          order past, present, and future.

          Users can browse their history because their ID is stored as a cookie.
          Once the request to the server is made, the server will validate the
          cookie, then the id in the database, then response with the users
          history.

          Each card will pop open a modal containing information about the
          chosen card. Users can read these bios to gain introspection about
          their past, present, and future.
