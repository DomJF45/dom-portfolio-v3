              2022 – Lab Rats – Created and continue to maintain Lab Rats, a
              full-stack research laboratory task management system made with
              React (client-slide) and Node (server-side) with a MongoDB NoSQL
              database under an AGILE development process. Applied systems
              architecture knowledge by diagramming the architecture and
              user-flow. In addition, scheduled each part of the web-apps
              lifecycle and broke it down into phases which was used to
              calculate a critical path using the Critical Path Method (CPM) for
              a timeline regarding product delivery.

              2021 – Vaping Dependency – Created a full-stack psychological web
              experiment that consists of a modified Stroop Task using Node and
              Express (server-side), AWS S3 buckets for CSV data storage, and
              standard HTML, JavaScript, and CSS alongside the JsPsych

              2021 – Stroop Task - Created the Stroop task (cognitive
              psychological evaluation measure) that was programmed entirely in
              C++. The project utilized the allegro 5 game library to construct
              visual stimuli triggered by user input. Additionally, the project
              utilized fundamental algorithms and data structures to create a
              working psychological experiment that tracks and logs the data
              obtained from the user input.
